# How To Use
Run the venturi call hijacker exe and create a debug config.
A Config should be saved on Config.Json of the directory executed.
Run call hijacker again and inject the dll, automatic detection works perfectly.
Now after you have injected the dll you can run the .exe that you injected it into and
it should leave a debug.txt that contains the information of the calls that were handled
Ex: https://i.imgur.com/Ekomjuc.png
Now you can just create a new config and according to the debug txt you can
make it patch the calls.

Care: You need to have the config.json on the same directory that the .exe is.
